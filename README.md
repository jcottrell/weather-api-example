Weather API Example
-------------------

[Weather API Example](http://jcottrell.github.io/weather-api-example/)

See the index.html file for the results of calling the weather api, courtesy of the [Weather Unlocked API](http://www.weatherunlocked.com/products/weather-api/overview).

See the weather.js file for the api and dom integration.

Comments are included in both files to help understand how the api is being used. There are also several TODOs that give some direction on how you might improve the interaction.

All the other files (links and scripts) are brought in from various CDNs to guard against confusion.
